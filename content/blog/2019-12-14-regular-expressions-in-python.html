<p>Hello! This semester I’ve been taking a class in which I’ve learned a little bit of Python, and I’d like to share some of what I learned, particularly regular expressions! Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that allow you to find matches in text.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import re

x=&quot;abc aac ac acb bac 1a6&quot;
re.findall(r&quot;a.&quot;,x)
## [&#39;ab&#39;, &#39;aa&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, &#39;a6&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>In the code above “a.” returns “a” and any character that follows the “a”. The “.” can be thought of as a wildcard and basically returns any character, letter or digit, following the “a”.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>string1=&quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&#39;,\&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking&quot;
print(string1)
## We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314&#39;,&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking
re.findall(r&quot;\d+&quot;,string1)
## [&#39;12&#39;, &#39;47&#39;, &#39;48&#39;, &#39;189&#39;, &#39;2036&#39;, &#39;314&#39;, &#39;125&#39;, &#39;789&#39;, &#39;1450&#39;, &#39;564&#39;, &#39;90456&#39;, &#39;7890&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Here we are trying to extract all the numbers from string1. Using “ allows you to return all digits 0-9 and the”+" means 1 or more times. So together “” returns all the numbers!</p>
<p>Below is a chart of useful symbols you can use when writing regular expressions!

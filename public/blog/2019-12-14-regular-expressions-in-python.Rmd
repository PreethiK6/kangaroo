```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
```

Hello! This semester I've been taking a class in which I've learned a little bit of Python, and I'd like to share some of what I learned, particularly regular expressions! Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that allow you to find matches in text.

```{python}
import re

x="abc aac ac acb bac 1a6"
re.findall(r"a.",x)
```

In the code above "a." returns "a" and any character that follows the "a". The "." can be thought of as a wildcard and basically returns any character, letter or digit, following the "a".

```{python}
string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"
print(string1)

re.findall(r"\d+",string1)
```

Here we are trying to extract all the numbers from string1. Using "\d" allows you to return all digits 0-9 and the "+" means 1 or more times. So together "\d+" returns all the numbers!

Below is a chart of useful symbols you can use when writing regular expressions!
